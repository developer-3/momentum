# What is Momentum?

Momentum is a completely open source, professional scheduling software. Powered by a powerful cloud computed mixed-integer linear programming algorithm, Momentum is robust and lightning fast.

Why did we choose to be open source? Nearly all professional scheduling software is gatekeeped by large paywalls and subscription based payment plans. Small and large businesses alike lose thousands of dollars to the common per-user-per-month payment scheme, but Momentum breaks this pattern and aims to help businesses of any size, anywhere.

With a focus on user experience and usability, Momentum aims to not only save businesses money, but also provide an environment where developers of all skill levels can help their community.
